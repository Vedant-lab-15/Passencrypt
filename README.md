The Password Encryption Tool is a command-line utility built using Python that emphasizes secure password handling through industry-standard encryption practices. Designed as a lightweight and effective solution for beginners and enthusiasts, this project reinforces core concepts in cybersecurity, cryptography, and CLI programming.
🔧 Features

    ✅ Password Strength Validation
    Ensures user-entered passwords meet strong criteria using regular expressions (length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).

    🔒 SHA-256 Hashing with Salt
    Applies secure salting and SHA‑256 hashing to prevent plain-text storage and make brute-force attacks infeasible.

    🛡️ No External Dependencies
    Built entirely using Python’s standard library (hashlib, os, getpass, re) — portable, lightweight, and easy to understand.

    📂 Optional Output to File
    Hashes and salt values can be stored in a local file, simulating a mini password database.

💡 Learning Outcome

This project showcases:

    Fundamental cryptographic principles (salting + hashing)

    Secure CLI interactions without exposing input

    Regex-based validation logic

    Clean and modular code with user-friendly prompts

🛠 Technologies Used

    Python 3.8+

    hashlib, os, getpass, re (Standard Library)

    Command Line Interface (CLI)

🌱 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

    Add login/verification feature

    Create a password vault with file-based storage

    Use bcrypt or argon2 for stronger hashing algorithms

    Turn it into a desktop GUI app using Tkinter or PyQt

⭐ Why It Stands Out

This project is a strong demonstration of practical Python skills, basic cryptography knowledge, and secure coding practices. It serves as a perfect introduction to cybersecurity programming while remaining simple enough to teach foundational concepts effectively.
